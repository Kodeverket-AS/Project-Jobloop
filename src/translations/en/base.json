    "title": "About us",
    "paragraph-1": "Jobloop started as a collaboration between social entrepreneurs, NAV, and several employers. In 2014, this resulted in an inclusion model that later became known as the Loop Model. Between 2014 and 2018, the model was further developed together with the employers’ organization Virke and implemented across several Norwegian counties. A 2018 FAFO report described it as inclusion work that truly works in practice. In 2017, Jobloop was established as its own company to continue and adapt the inclusion model to new industries and target groups. An important collaboration has been with the startup community connected to the Bergen.Works coworking space, where the model was adapted for “the new jobs” in IT development, creative technology, and growth companies.",
    "paragraph-2": "Today, the model is best known as “Kodehode” – a program that nurtures and trains talented junior developers for IT jobs in close collaboration with the industry itself. The driving forces behind the company have always been passionate about tailoring models for those who didn’t quite succeed the first time or who risk dropping out of education. This has resulted in continuous adjustments to new target groups, including pupils as young as those in primary school. Today, we work with vocational rehabilitation companies, clubhouse organizations, NAV, municipalities, county councils, schools, child welfare services, educational counseling (PPT and OT), and ordinary employers. Jobloop is a rapidly growing company driven by social entrepreneurs. We have an important mission: to reduce social exclusion by preventing school dropout, qualifying people, and connecting more individuals to work! To achieve this, we collaborate with public institutions, educational organizations, and local businesses.",
    "paragraph-3": "We offer programs targeting children in primary school, upper secondary students, and adult job seekers. At the same time, we stay close to the labor market and continuously fine-tune our programs based on trends and needs. We support the Norwegian IT industry and believe that inclusion and alternative qualification models will be essential to close the growing skills gap.",
    "paragraph-4": "In 2024, we received the FERD Award 'Social Entrepreneur of the Year' for our work combating involuntary school absence. Did you know that 20–30% of young people in Norway do not complete upper secondary school, and that many drop out already during primary school? Ten years of innovative partnerships and dedicated work have resulted in us now being a proud provider of a range of opportunities for children, youth, and adults who want new paths into working life. Jobloop has been particularly successful in creating innovative learning and mastery environments that appeal to young people with interests in creative digital subjects, gaming, and IT.",
